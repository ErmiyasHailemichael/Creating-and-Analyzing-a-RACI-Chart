## 📋 Part 2: RACI Chart Analysis

### Step 4: Analyze Your Chart and Identify Gaps

✅ **Gaps:**
- No task is missing a Responsible (R) or Accountable (A) role.

✅ **Overlaps:**
- Only reasonable overlaps (for example, the Traveler has several R’s, which is expected).

✅ **Balance:**
- Ermiyas has most R’s, which makes sense — the traveler does most of the work.
- Financial Advisor Solomon is only heavy on Financial Preparation — balanced overall.
- Local Contact Tsegay mainly supports local tasks.

✅ **Consultation:**
- C’s are used correctly, mostly for supportive guidance (Fre, Dr. Elesa, Tsegay).

✅ **Information Flow:**
- Emergency Contact Medi is informed (I) for almost every major task, ensuring communication.

---

### ✅ Final Conclusion:
No major changes were needed.  
The chart is well balanced and supports smooth project execution.

## 📋 Part 3: Integration into Confluence (or Google Docs)

### Steps to Add the RACI Chart

1. Open the relevant Confluence project page.
2. Click **Insert** > **Table**.
3. Set up the table:
   - **Rows:** 11 (10 tasks + 1 header row)
   - **Columns:** 7 (6 roles + 1 task column)
4. First row (headers) = Task | Ermiyas | Sofia | Dr. Mark | Liam | Hana | Marta
5. Fill each cell with R, A, C, or I based on the RACI Chart.
6. Save and tag team members (if applicable) for transparency.

---

### Where to Embed the RACI Chart

- **Project Planning Document:**  
  So everyone involved sees task breakdowns before the trip.

- **Emergency Plan Document:**  
  So critical roles (especially Marta's role) are clear if emergencies happen.
