# ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Script - Trip to Ethiopia RACI Chart Project

## 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

Hi everyone, my name is Ermiyas.  
Today, Iâ€™m going to present my project for building a RACI chart based on a real-world scenario: planning and executing a trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

---

## 2. Project Overview (1 minute)

The purpose of this project was to apply RACI chart principles to a practical experience.  
I recently traveled to Addis Ababa, so I decided to structure the planning process like a project â€” identifying tasks, roles, and responsibilities to improve organization and clarity.

## 3. Tasks and Workload Breakdown (1â€“2 minutes)

I identified 10 major tasks to ensure a smooth trip, including:
- Booking flights
- Arranging accommodations
- Packing essentials
- Disconnecting from my American phone line and setting up an eSIM

Each task was broken down into clear, actionable steps to avoid confusion and delays.

## 4. Roles and Assignments (1â€“2 minutes)

I defined six major roles for the project:
- I was the main traveler (Ermiyas).
- My travel agent Fre helped with bookings.
- Dr. Elesa advised me medically.
- Solomon supported financial preparation.
- Tsegay helped locally in Ethiopia.
- Medi, my mom, served as my emergency contact.

Each role was assigned based on expertise and availability.

## 5. RACI Chart Walkthrough (1â€“2 minutes)

The RACI chart clearly assigned:
- **A/R** (Accountable and Responsible) for primary actions
- **C** (Consulted) for expert advice
- **I** (Informed) for status updates

Example:
- For booking flights: I was both Responsible and Accountable, Fre was Consulted, and the others were Informed.
- For emergency planning: Medi, my mom, was Accountable to ensure safety protocols were ready.

## 6. Analysis Results (1 minute)

After analyzing the RACI chart:
- No task was missing a Responsible or Accountable person.
- Responsibilities were balanced.
- Consultation and information flow were handled well.

No major revisions were needed.

## 7. Integration into Project Management Tools (30â€“45 seconds)

If this were a formal project, I would embed the RACI chart into a Confluence page or Google Doc for team visibility.  
I also created a live Google Doc version for easy sharing and editing.

## 8. Closing (15â€“30 seconds)

Thank you for watching my presentation!  
I enjoyed applying project management concepts to a real-life trip.
